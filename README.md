## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Stylus Preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

THe main thing i learned was stylus, whick is a CSS preprocessor that lets you use a lot of features that don't come with CSS by default. It was really fun learning about it and it will help me in the future to write CSS quicker.

### Continued development

In future projects i would like to try out other preprocessors like SCSS or LESS so i can decide whick one i like more.
